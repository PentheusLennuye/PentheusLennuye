My name is George Cummings. I have been in the IT industry for over 30 years as administrator, coder, DevOps enthusiast, student, and instructor. I live in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, Canada.

## Career In A Nutshell

My career has been mostly as system and network administrator with some side jobs as instructor – not necessarily always in IT. Currently I’m a senior automation "architect" at a major multinational computing firm, working on cloud infrastructure management and automation. This means I work in a development/"tiger"/centre-of-excellence team married to network services and Kubernetes. I spend my time coding in Python, acting as the spokesperson for the team in demonstrations, providing guidance to junior developers, improving documentation, encouraging info management, and maintaining team morale.

Necessity leads me to experiment in Go although I'd rather poke around in Rust and fiddle with Haskell.

## Current Interests

## Education

In 2022, I completed my Master of Management of Artificial Intelligence from the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Previously, I obtained a BA in Computer Science from York University in Toronto way back in 1998. As a professional, of course, I'm constantly looking to update. Flexibility is key.
