# Senior IT Infrastructure and Automation DevOps Programmer/Analyst

My name is George Cummings. I have been in the IT industry for over 30 years as administrator, coder, DevOps enthusiast, student, and instructor. I live in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, Canada.

## Tools

- Software: My primary tools are nvim, Visual Studio Code, Kubernetes, and Docker. My secondary is Obsidian.
- Equipment:
  - Employer daily driver: MacBook Pro, Apple Silicon
  - Personal daily driver: personally built PC built on a Fractal North chassis running NixOS
  - Personal laptop: Thinkbook 14s Yoga IRL, also running NixOS
  - Kubernetes cluster: HP ProDesk minis running, you guessed it, NixOS
  - A variety of VMs, switches, Raspberry Pi's, and so on.
- Languages:
  - My primary procedural/OOP/FP language is Python.
  - Secondaries are Golang and more bash than I thought possible.
  - DSL's such as Ansible's YAML, Puppet's Ruby, and I've forgotten PHP, Perl, C, Macro/Assembly and Commodore Basic.

## Career

My career has been mostly as system and network administrator with some side jobs as instructor – not necessarily always in IT. Currently I’m a senior automation "architect" (a position, not a qualification) at a major multinational computing firm. My life revolves around cloud infrastructure management and automation. This means I work in a development/"tiger"/centre-of-excellence team married to network services and Kubernetes. I spend my time coding in Python, acting as the spokesperson for the team in demonstrations, providing guidance to junior developers, improving documentation, encouraging info management, and maintaining team morale.

Necessity leads me to experiment in Go although I'd rather poke around in Rust and fiddle with Haskell.

## Education

In 2022, I completed my Master of Management of Artificial Intelligence from the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. The degree enables one to lead AI project teams, although I am quite happy being a senior dev who can take care of his team as a colleague. Previously, I obtained a BA in Computer Science from York University in Toronto way back in 1998. As a professional, of course, I'm constantly looking to update. Flexibility is key.
